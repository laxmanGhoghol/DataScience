# DataScience
When i was learning about computer vision and neural networks i created this project. It's actually a guided project from cousera(Online learning platform).
I have used jupyter notebook for creating model. It is self explanatoryn with comments. After creating model i have saved its architecture and weights.
Later on for flask app i have used those early created model weights and start testing with videos, images and webcame. it works very well...
i have used haarcascade for face detetction and for training on facial expression i have used kaggle facial expression data-set.

thanks to... 
cousera guided project on -- Facial Expression Recognition
